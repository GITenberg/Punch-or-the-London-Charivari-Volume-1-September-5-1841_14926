<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/008-01.png"><img src=
"images/008-01.png" alt=
"A man on a horse charges through a laurel wreath in the shape of an O"
id="img008-01" name="img008-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">O</span>ur consideration must now be given to
those essentials in the construction of a true gentleman&mdash;the
cut, ornaments, and pathology of his dress.</p>
<h4>THE CUT</h4>
<p>is to the garment what the royal head and arms are to the
coin&mdash;the insignia that give it currency. No matter what the
material, gold or copper, Saxony or sackcloth, the die imparts a
value to the one, and the shears to the other.</p>
<p>Ancient Greece still lives in its marble demi-gods; the
vivifying chisel of Phidias was thought worthy to typify the
sublimity of Jupiter; the master-hand of Canova wrought the Parian
block into the semblance of the sea-born goddess, giving to
insensate stone the warmth and etheriality of the Paphian paragon;
and Stultz, with his grace-bestowing shears, has fashioned West of
England broad-cloths, and fancy goods, into all the nobility and
gentility of the &ldquo;Blue Book,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Court
Guide,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Army, Navy, and Law Lists, for
1841.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondrous and kindred arts! The sculptor wrests the rugged block
from the rocky ribs of his mother earth;&mdash;the tailor clips the
implicated &ldquo;<em>long hogs</em>&rdquo;<sup>1</sup><span class=
"sidenote">1. The first growth of wool.</span> from the prolific
backs of the living mutton;&mdash;the toothless saw, plied by an
unweayring hand, prepares the stubborn mass for the chisel&rsquo;s
tracery;&mdash;the loom, animated by steam (that gigantic child of
Wallsend and water), twists and twines the unctuous and pliant
fleece into the silky Saxony.</p>
<p>The sculptor, seated in his <em>studio</em>, throws loose the
reins of his imagination, and, conjuring up some perfect ideality,
seeks to impress the beautiful illusion on the rude and undigested
mass before him. The tailor spreads out, upon his ample board, the
happy broadcloth; his eyes scan the &ldquo;measured proportions of
his client,&rdquo; and, with mystic power, guides the obedient
pipe-clay into the graceful diagram of a perfect gentleman. The
sculptor, with all the patient perseverance of genius, conscious of
the greatness of its object, chips, and chips, and chips, from day
to day; and as the stone quickens at each touch, he glows with all
the pride of the creative Prometheus, mingled with the gentler
ecstacies of paternal love. The tailor, with fresh-ground shears,
and perfect faith in the gentility and solvency of his
&ldquo;client,&rdquo; snips, and snips, and snips, until the
&ldquo;superfine&rdquo; grows, with each abscission, into the first
style of elegance and fashion, and the excited schneider feels
himself &ldquo;every inch a king,&rdquo; his shop a herald&rsquo;s
college, and every brown paper pattern garnishing its walls, an
escutcheon of gentility.</p>
<p>But to dismount from our Pegasus, or, in other words, to cut the
poetry, and come to the practice of our subject, it is necessary
that a perfect gentleman should be cut <em>up</em> very high, or
cut <em>down</em> very low&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, up to the marquis
or down to the jarvey. Any intermediate style is perfectly
inadmissible; for who above the grade of an attorney would wear a
coat with pockets inserted in the tails, like salt-boxes; or any
but an incipient Esculapius indulge in trousers that evinced a
morbid ambition to become knee-breeches, and were only restrained
in their aspirations by a pair of most strenuous straps. We will
now proceed to details.</p>
<p><em>The dressing-gown</em> should be cut only&mdash;for the arm
holes; but be careful that the quantity of material be very
ample&mdash;say four times as much as is positively necessary, for
nothing is so characteristic of a perfect gentleman as his
improvidence. This garment must be constructed without buttons or
button-holes, and confined at the waist with cable-like bell-ropes
and tassels. This elegant <em>d&eacute;shabille</em> had its origin
(like the Corinthian capital from the Acanthus) in accident. A set
of massive window-curtains having been carelessly thrown over a lay
figure, or tailor&rsquo;s <em>torso</em>, in Nugee&rsquo;s
<em>studio</em>, in St. James&rsquo;s-street, suggested to the
luxuriant mind of the Adonisian D&rsquo;Orsay, this beautiful
combination of costume and upholstery. The eighteen-shilling chintz
great-coats, so ostentatiously put forward by nefarious tradesmen
as dressing-gowns, and which resemble pattern-cards of the
vegetable kingdom, are unworthy the notice of all
gentlemen&mdash;of course excepting those who are so by act of
Parliament. Although it is generally imagined that the coat is the
principal article of dress, <em>we</em> attach far greater
importance to the trousers, the cut of which should, in the first
place, be regulated by nature&rsquo;s cut of the leg. A gentleman
who labours under either a convex or a concave leg, cannot be too
particular in the arrangement of the strap-draught. By this we mean
that a concave leg must have the pull on the convex side, and
<em>vice versa</em>, the garment being made full, the effects of
bad nursing are, by these means, effectually
&ldquo;repealed.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote">2.
Baylis.</span> This will be better understood if the reader will
describe a parallelogram, and draw therein the arc of a circle
equal to that described by his leg, whether knock-kneed or
bandy.</p>
<p>If the leg be perfectly straight, then the principal peculiarity
of cut to be attended to, is the external assurance that the
trousers cannot be removed from the body without the assistance of
a valet.</p>
<p>The other considerations should be their applicability to the
promenade or the equestriade. We are indebted to our friend Beau
Reynolds for this original idea and it is upon the plan formerly
adopted by him that we now proceed to advise as to the maintenance
of the distinctions.</p>
<p>Let your schneider baste the trousers together, and when you
have put them on, let them be braced to their natural tension; the
schneider should then, with a small pair of scissors, <em>cut
out</em> all the wrinkles which offend the eye. The garment, being
removed from your person, is again taken to the tailor&rsquo;s
laboratory, and the embrasures carefully and artistically
fine-drawn. The process for walking or riding trousers only varies
in these particulars&mdash;for the one you should stand upright,
for the other you should straddle the back of a chair. Trousers cut
on these principles entail only two inconveniences, to which every
one with the true feelings of a gentleman would willingly submit.
You must never attempt to sit down in your walking trousers, or
venture to assume an upright position in your equestrians, for
compound fractures in the region of the <em>os sacrum</em>, or
dislocations about the <em>genu patell&aelig;</em> are certain to
be the results of such rashness, and then</p>

<h3>THE LAST HAUL.</h3>
<p>The ponds in St. James&rsquo;s Park were on last Monday drawn
with nets, and a large quantity of the fish preserved there carried
away by direction of the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests.
Our talented correspondent, Ben D&rsquo;Israeli, sends us the
following squib on the circumstance:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Oh! never more,&rdquo; Duncannon cried,</p>

take</p>
<p class="i2">Our last sad haul amongst the
<em>fishes</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>GENERAL SATISFACTION.</h3>
<p>Lord Coventry declared emphatically that the sons, the fathers,
and the grandfathers were all satisfied with the present corn laws.
Had his lordship thought of the <em>Herald</em>, he might have
added, &ldquo;and the grandmothers also.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ADVERTISEMENT.</h3>
<p>If the enthusiastic individual who distinguished himself on the
O.P. side of third row in the pit of &ldquo;the late Theatre Royal
English Opera House,&rdquo; but now the refuge for the
self-baptised &ldquo;Council of Dramatic Literature,&rdquo; can be
warranted sober, and guaranteed an umbrella, in the use of which he
is decidedly unrivalled, he is requested to apply to the Committee
of management, where he will hear of something to his
&ldquo;advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>&ldquo;PUNCH&rsquo;S&rdquo; LITERATURE.</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>&ldquo;The Hungarian Daughter,&rdquo; a Dramatic Poem, by
George Stephens, 8vo., pp. 294. London: 1841.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Introductory(!) Preface to the above,&rdquo; pp.
25.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Supplement to the above;&rdquo; consisting of

<li>&ldquo;Opinions of the Press upon the &lsquo;Dramatic
Merits&rsquo; and &lsquo;Actable Qualities&rsquo; of the Hungarian
Daughter,&rdquo; 8vo., <em>closely printed</em>, pp. 16.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blind and vulgar prejudice in favour of Shakspeare,
Massinger, and the elder dramatic poets&mdash;the sickening
adulation bestowed upon Sheridan Knowles and Talfourd, among the
moderns&mdash;and the base, malignant, and selfish partiality of
theatrical managers, who insist upon performing those plays only
which are adapted to the stage&mdash;whose grovelling souls have no
sympathy with genius&mdash;whose ideas are fixed upon gain, have
hitherto smothered those blazing illuminati, George Stephens and
his syn&mdash;Syncretcis; have hindered their literary effulgence
from breaking through the mists hung before the eyes of the public,
by a weak, infatuated adherence to paltry Nature, and a silly
infatuation in favour of those who copy her.</p>
<p>At length, however, the public blushes (through its
representative, the provincial press, and the above-named critical
puffs,) with shame&mdash;the managers are fast going mad with
bitter vexation, for having, to use the words of that elegant
pleonasm, the <em>introductory</em> preface, &ldquo;by a sort of
<em>ex officio</em> hallucination,&rdquo; rejected this and some
twenty other exquisite, though unactable dramas! It is a fact, that
since the opening of the English Opera House, Mr. Webster has been
confined to his room; Macready has suspended every engagement for
Drury-lane; and the managers of Covent Garden have gone the
atrocious length of engaging sibilants and ammunition from the
neighbouring market, to pelt the Syncretics off the stage! Them we
leave to their dirty work and their repentance, while we proceed to
<em>our</em> &ldquo;delightful task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To prove that the &ldquo;mantle of the Elizabethan poets seems
to have fallen upon Mr. Stephens&rdquo; (<em>Opinions</em>, p. 11),
that the &ldquo;Hungarian Daughter&rdquo; is quite as good as
Knowles&rsquo;s best plays (<em>Id.</em> p. 4, <em>in two
places</em>), that &ldquo;it is equal to Goethe&rdquo;
(<em>Id.</em> p. 11), that &ldquo;in after years the name of Mr. S.
will be amongst those which have given light and glory to their
country&rdquo; (<em>Id.</em> p. 10); to prove, in short, the truth
of a hundred other laudations collected and printed by this modest
author, we shall quote a few passages from his play, and illustrate
his genius by pointing out their beauties&mdash;an office much
needed, particularly by certain dullards, the magazine of whose
souls are not combustible enough to take fire at the electric
sparks shot forth <em>up</em> out of the depths of George
Stephens&rsquo;s unfathomable genius!</p>
<p>The first gem that sparkles in the play, is where
<em>Isabella</em>, the Queen Dowager of Hungary, with a degree of
delicacy highly becoming a matron, makes desperate love to
<em>Castaldo</em>, an Austrian ambassador. In the midst of her
ravings she breaks off, to give such a description of a
steeple-chase as Nimrod has never equalled.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">ISABELLA (<em>hotly</em>). &ldquo;Love <em>rides</em>
upon a thought,</p>
<p>And stays not dully to <em>inquire the way</em>,</p>
<p>But right <em>o&rsquo;erleaps the fence</em> unto the
<em>goal</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To appreciate the splendour of this image, the reader must
conceive Love booted and spurred, mounted upon a <em>thought</em>,
saddled and bridled. He starts. <em>Yo-hoiks</em>! what a pace! He
stops not to &ldquo;inquire the way&rdquo;&mdash;whether he is to
take the first turning to the right, or the second to the
left&mdash;but on, on he rushes, clears the fence cleverly, and
wins by a dozen lengths!</p>
<p>What soul, what mastery, what poetical skill is here! We
triumphantly put forth this passage as an instance of the sublime
art of sinking in poetry not to be matched by Dibdin Pitt or Jacob
Jones. Love is sublimed to a jockey, Thought promoted to a
race-horse!&mdash;&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But splendid as this is, Mr. Stephens can make the force of
bathos go a little further. The passage continues (&ldquo;<em>a
pause</em>&rdquo; intervening, to allow breathing ime, after the
splitting pace with which Love has been riding upon Thought)
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Are your lips free? A smile will make no noise.</p>
<p>What ignorance! So! Well! <em>I&rsquo;ll to breakfast
straight</em>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">ISABELLA. &ldquo;Ha! ha! These forms are
air&mdash;mere counterfeits</p>
<p>Of my <em>imaginous</em> heart, <em>as are the whirling</em></p>
<p><em>Wainscot and trembling floor</em>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The idea of transferring the seat of imagination from the head
to the heart, and causing it to exhibit the wainscot in a
pirouette, and the floor in an ague, is highly
<em>Shakesperesque</em>, and, as the <em>Courier</em> is made to
say at page 3 of the <em>Opinions</em>, &ldquo;is worthy of the
best days of that noble school of dramatic literature in which Mr.
Stephens has so successfully studied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This well-deserved praise&mdash;the success with which the
author has studied, in a school, the models of which were human
feelings and nature,&mdash;we have yet to illustrate from other
passages. Mr. Stephens evinces his full acquaintance with Nature by
a familiarity with her convulsions: whirlwinds, thunder, lightning,
earthquakes, and volcanoes&mdash;are this gentleman&rsquo;s
playthings. When, for instance, <em>Rupert</em> is going to be
gallant to Queen Isabella, she exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Dire lightnings! Scoundrel! Help!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Martinuzzi</em> conveys a wish for his nobles to
laugh&mdash;an order for a sort of court cachinnation&mdash;in
these pretty terms:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;<em>Blow it about</em>, ye opposite winds of heaven,</p>
<p>Till the loud chorus of derision shake</p>
<p>The world with laughter!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When he feels uncomfortable at something he is told in the first
act, the Cardinal complains thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Ha! earthquakes quiver in my flesh!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which the <em>Britannia</em> is so good as to tell us is
superior to Byron; while the <em>Morning Herald</em> kindly
remarks, that &ldquo;a more vigorous and expressive line was
<em>never</em> penned. In five words it illustrates the fiercest
passions of humanity by the direst convulsion of nature:&rdquo;
(<em>Opinions</em>, p. 7) a criticism which illustrates the
fiercest throes of nonsense, by the direst convulsions of
ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Castaldo</em>, being anxious to murder the Cardinal with, we
suppose, all &ldquo;means and appliances to boot,&rdquo; asks of
heaven a trifling favour:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Heaven, that look&rsquo;st on,</p>
<p>Rain thy broad deluge first! All-teeming earth</p>
<p>Disgorge thy poisons, till the attainted air</p>
<p>Offend the sense! Thou, miscreative hell,</p>
<p>Let loose calamity!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But it is not only in the &ldquo;sublime and beautiful that Mr.
Stephens&rsquo;s genius delights&rdquo; (<em>vide Opinions</em>, p.
4); his play exhibits sentiments of high morality, quite worthy of
the &ldquo;Editor of the Church of England Quarterly Review,&rdquo;
the author of &ldquo;Lay Sermons,&rdquo; and other religious works.
For example: the lady-killer, <em>Castaldo</em>, is
&ldquo;hotly&rdquo; loved by the queen-mother, while he prefers the
queen-daughter. The last and <em>Castaldo</em> are together. The
dowager overhears their billing and cooing, and thus, with great
moderation, sends her supposed daughter to &mdash;&mdash;. But the
author shall speak for himself:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">&ldquo;Ye viprous twain!</p>
<p>Swift whirlwinds snatch ye both to fire as endless</p>
<p>And infinite as hell! May it embrace ye!</p>
<p>And burn&mdash;burn limbs and sinews, souls, until</p>
<p>It wither ye both up&mdash;both&mdash;in its arms!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Elegant denunciation!&mdash;&ldquo;viprous,&rdquo;
&ldquo;hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;sinews and souls.&rdquo; Has Goethe ever
written anything like this? Certainly not. Therefore the
&ldquo;Monthly&rdquo; <em>is</em> right at p. 11 of the
<em>Opinions</em>. Stephens must be equal, if not superior, to the
author of &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more specimen of delicate sentiment from the lips of a
virgin concerning the lips of her lover, will fully establish the
Syncretic code of moral taste:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">CZERINA (<em>faintly</em>). &ldquo;Do breathe heat
into me:</p>
<p>Lay thy warm breath unto my bloodless lips:</p>
<p>I stagger; I&mdash;I must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">CASTALDO. &ldquo;In mercy, what?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">CZERINA. &ldquo;Wed!!!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The lady ends, most maidenly, by fainting in her lover&rsquo;s
arms.</p>
<p>A higher flight is elsewhere taken. <em>Isabella</em> urges
<em>Castaldo</em> to murder <em>Martinuzzi</em>, in a sentence that
has a powerful effect upon the feelings, for it makes us shudder as
we copy it&mdash;it will cause even <em>our</em> readers to tremble
when they see it. The idea of using <em>blasphemy</em> as an
instrument for shocking the minds of an audience, is as original as
it is worthy of the <em>sort</em> of genius Mr. Stephens possesses.
Alluding to a poniard, <em>Isabella</em> says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Sheath it where <em>God</em> and nature prompt your
hand!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is to say, in the breast of a cardinal!!</p>
<p>The vulgar, who set up the common-place standards of nature,
probability, moral propriety, and respect for such sacred names as
they are careful never to utter, except with reverence, will
perhaps condemn Mr. Stephens (the aforesaid &ldquo;Editor of the
Church of England Quarterly Review,&rdquo; and author of other
religious works) with unmitigated severity. They must not be too
hasty. Mr. Stephens is a genius, and cannot, therefore, be held
accountable for the <em>meaning</em> <span class="pagenum"><a id=

even blasphemous; more than that he is a Syncretic genius, and his
associates, by the designation they have chosen, by the terms of
their agreement, are bound to cry each other up&mdash;to defend one
another from the virulent attacks of common sense and plain reason.
They are sworn to <em>stick</em> together, like the bundle of rods
in &AElig;sop&rsquo;s fable.</p>

<p>SYNCRETISM.</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Stephens, their chief, the god of their idolatry, is,
consequently, more mad, or, according to their creed, a greater
genius, than the rest; and evidently writes passages he would
shudder to pen, if he knew the meaning of them. Upon paper,
therefore, the Syncretics are not accountable beings; and when
condemned to the severest penalties of critical law, must be
reprieved on the plea of literary insanity.</p>
<p>It may be said that we have descended to mere detail to
illustrate Mr. Stephens&rsquo; peculiar genius&mdash;that we ought
to treat of the grand design, or plot of the <em>Hungarian
Daughter</em>; but we must confess, with the deepest humility, that
our abilities are unequal to the task. The fable soars far beyond
the utmost flights of our poor conjectures, of our limited
comprehension. We know that at the end there are&mdash;one case of
poisoning, one ditto of stabbing with intent, &amp;c., and one
ditto of sudden death. Hence we conclude that the play is a
tragedy; but one which &ldquo;cannot be intended for an acting
play&rdquo; (<em>preliminary preface</em>, p.1,)&mdash;of course
<em>as</em> a tragedy; yet so universal is the author&rsquo;s
genius, that an adaptation of the <em>Hungarian Daughter</em>, as a
broad comedy, has been produced at the &ldquo;Dramatic
Authors&rsquo; Theatre,&rdquo; having been received with roars of
laughter!</p>
<p>The books before us have been expensively got up. In the
<em>Hungarian Daughter</em>, &ldquo;rivers of type flow through
meadows of margin,&rdquo; to the length of nearly three hundred
pages. Mr. Stephens is truly a most spirited printer and publisher
of his own works.</p>
<p>But the lavish outlay he must have incurred to obtain such a
number of favourable notices&mdash;so many columns of superlative
praise&mdash;shows him to be, in every sense&mdash;like the prince
of puffers, George Robins&mdash;&ldquo;utterly regardless of
expense.&rdquo; The works third and fourth upon our list, doubtless
cost, for the <em>copyright</em> alone, in ready money, a fortune.
It is astonishing what pecuniary sacrifices genius will make, when
it purloins the trumpet of Fame to <em>puff</em> itself into
temporary notoriety.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT CRICKET MATCH AT ST. STEPHEN&rsquo;S.</h3>
<h4>FIRST INNINGS.</h4>
<p>The return match between the Reform and Carlton Clubs has been
the theme of general conversation during the past week. Some
splendid play was exhibited on the occasion, and, although the
result has realised the anticipations of the best judges, it was
not achieved without considerable exertion.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that, the last time these celebrated clubs
met, the Carlton men succeeded in scoring one notch more than their
rivals; who, however, immediately challenged them to a return
match, and have been diligently practising for success since that
time.</p>
<p>The players assembled in <em>Lord&rsquo;s</em> Cricket Ground on
Tuesday last, when the betting was decidedly in favour of the Cons,
whose appearance and manner was more confident than usual; while,
on the contrary, the Rads seemed desponding and shy. On tossing up,
the Whigs succeeded in getting first innings, and the Tories
dispersed themselves about the field in high glee, flattering
themselves that they would not be <em>out</em> long.</p>
<p>Wellington, on producing the ball&mdash;a genuine
<em>Duke</em>&mdash;excited general admiration by his position.
Ripon officiated as bowler at the other wicket. Sibthorp acted as
long-stop, and the rest found appropriate situations. Lefevre was
chosen umpire by mutual consent.</p>
<p>Spencer and Clanricarde went in first. Spencer, incautiously
trying to score too many notches for one of his hits, was stumped
out by Ripon, and Melbourne succeeded him. Great expectations had
been formed of this player by his own party, but he was utterly
unable to withstand Wellington&rsquo;s rapid bowling, which soon
sent him to the right-about. Clanricarde was likewise run out
without scoring a notch.</p>
<p>Lansdowne and Brougham were now partners at the wickets; but
Lansdowne did not appear to like his mate, on whose play it is
impossible to calculate. Coventry, <em>the short slip</em>, excited
much merriment, by a futile attempt to catch this player out, which
terminated in his finding himself horizontal and mortified.
Wellington, having bowled out Lansdowne, resigned his ball to Peel,
who took his place at the wicket with a smile of confidence, which
frightened the bat out of the hands of Phillips, the next Rad.</p>
<p>Dundas and Labouchere were now the batmen. Labouchere is a very
intemperate player. One of Sandon&rsquo;s slow balls struck his
thumb, and put him out of temper, whereupon he hit about at random,
and knocked down his wicket. Wakley took his bat, but apparently
not liking his position, he hit up and caught himself out.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell took his place with a lounging swagger, but his
first ball was caught by the immortal Sibthorp, who uttered more
puns on the occasion than the oldest man present recollected to
have heard perpetrated in any given time. Russell&mdash;who, by the
bye, excavated several quarts of &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; during his
innings&mdash;was the last man the Rads had to put in. He played
with care, and appeared disposed to keep hold of the bat as long as
possible. He was, however, quietly disposed of by one of
Peel&rsquo;s inexorable balls.</p>
<p>Thus far the game has proceeded. The Cons have yet to <em>go
in</em>. The general opinion is, that they will not remain in so
long as the Rads, but that they will score their notches much
quicker. Indeed, it was commonly remarked, that no players had ever
remained in so long, and had done so little good withal, as the
Reformites.</p>
<p>Betting is at 100 to 5 in favour of the Carlton men, and anxiety
is on tip-toe to know the result of the next innings.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Tories are exulting in their recent victory over the poor
Whigs, whom they affirm have been <em>tried</em>, and found
wanting. A <em>trial</em>, indeed, where all the jurors were
witnesses for the prosecution. One thing is certain, that the
country, as usual, will have to pay the costs, for a Tory verdict
will be certain to carry them. The Whigs should prepare a motion
for a new trial, on the plea that the late decision was that of</p>

<h3>CURIOUS COINCIDENCE.</h3>
<p>The <em>Morning Advertiser</em> has a paragraph containing a
report of an extraordinary indisposition under which a private of
the Royal Guards is now suffering. It appears he lately received a
violent kick from a horse, on the back of his head: since which
time his hair has become so sensitive, that he cannot bear any one
to approach him or touch it. On some portion being cut off by
stratagem, he evinced the utmost disgust, accompanied with a volley
of oaths. This may be wonderful in French hair, but it is nothing
to the present sufferings of the Whigs in England.</p>

<h2>THE BARTHOLOMEW FAIR SHOW-FOLKS.</h2>
<p>Punch having been chosen by the unanimous voice of the
public&mdash;the <em>arbiter elegantiarum</em> in all matters
relating to science, literature, and the fine arts&mdash;and from
his long professional experience, being the only person in England
competent to regulate the public amusements of the people, the Lord
Mayor of London has confided to him the delicate and important duty
of deciding upon the claims of the several individuals applying for
licenses to open show-booths during the approaching Bartholomew
Fair. Punch, having called to his assistance Sir Peter Laurie and
Peter Borthwick, proceeded, on last Saturday, to hold his
inquisition in a highly-respectable court in the neighbourhood of
West Smithfield.</p>
<p>The first application was made on behalf of
<em>Richardson&rsquo;s Booth</em>, by two individuals named
Melbourne and Russell.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;On what grounds do you claim?</p>
<p>MEL.&mdash;On those of long occupancy and respectability, my
lord.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;We employs none but the werry best of actors, my
lud&mdash;all &ldquo;bould speakers,&rdquo; as my late wenerated
manager, Muster Richardson, used to call &lsquo;em.</p>
<p>MEL.&mdash;We have the best scenery and decorations, the most
popular performances&mdash;</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;Hem! (<em>aside to</em> MEL.)&mdash;Best say nothing
about our performances, Mel.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Pray what situations do you respectively hold in
the booth?</p>
<p>MEL.&mdash;<em>I</em> am principal manager, and do the heavy
tragedy business. My friend, here, is the stage-manager and low
comedy buffer, who takes the kicks, and blows the trumpet of the
establishment.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;What is the nature of the entertainments you have
been in the habit of producing?</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;Oh! the real legitimate drammar&mdash;&ldquo;A New
Way to Pay Old Debts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Raising the Wind,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A Gentleman in Difficulties,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where shall I
dine?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Honest Thieves.&rdquo; We mean to commence
the present season with &ldquo;All in the wrong,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;His Last Legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Humph! I am sorry to say I have received several
complaints of the manner in which you have conducted the business
of your establishment for several years. It appears you put forth
bills promising wonders, while your performances have been of the
lowest possible description.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;S&rsquo;elp me, Bob! there ain&rsquo;t a word of
truth in it. If there&rsquo;s anything we takes pride on,
&rsquo;tis our gentility.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;You have degraded the drama by the introduction of
card-shufflers and thimble-rig impostors.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;We denies the thimble-rigging in totum, my lud; that
was brought out at Stanley&rsquo;s opposition booth.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;At least you were a promoter of state conjuring and
legerdemain tricks on the stage.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;Only a little hanky-panky, my lud. The people likes
it; they loves to be cheated before their faces. One, two,
three&mdash;presto&mdash;begone. I&rsquo;ll show your ludship as
pretty a trick of putting a piece of money in your eye and taking
it out of your elbow, as you ever beheld. <em>Has</em> your ludship
got such a thing as a good shilling about you? &rsquo;Pon my
honour, I&rsquo;ll return it.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Be more respectful, sir, and reply to my questions.
It appears further, that several respectable persons have lost
their honesty in your booth.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;Very little of that &rsquo;ere commodity is ever
brought into it, my lud.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;And, in short, that you and your colleagues&rsquo;
hands have been frequently found in the pockets of your
audience.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;Only in a professional way, my lud&mdash;strictly
professional.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;But the most serious charge of all is that, on a
recent occasion, when the audience hissed your performances, you
put out the lights, let in the swell-mob, and raised a cry of
&ldquo;No Corn Laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;Why, my lud, on that p&rsquo;int I admit there was a
slight row.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Enough, sir. The court considers you have grossly
misconducted yourself, and refuses to grant you license to
perform.</p>
<p>MEL.&mdash;But, my lord, I protest <em>I did</em> nothing.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;So everybody says, sir. You are therefore unfit to
have the management of (next to my own) the greatest theatre in the
world. You may retire.</p>
<p>MEL. (<em>to</em> RUSS.)&mdash;Oh! Johnny, this is your
work&mdash;with your confounded hanky-panky.</p>
<p>RUSS.&mdash;No&mdash;&rsquo;twas you that did it; we have been
ruined by your laziness. What <em>is</em> to become of us now?</p>
<p>MEL.&mdash;Alas! where shall we dine?</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The next individual who presented himself, to obtain a license
for the Carlton Club Equestrian Troop, was a strange-loooking
character, who gave his name as Sibthorp.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;What are you, sir?</p>
<p>SIB.&mdash;Clown to the ring, my lord, and principal performer
on the Salt-box. I provide my own paint and pipe-clay, make my own
jokes, and laugh at them too. I do the ground and lofty tumbling,
and ride the wonderful donkey&mdash;all for the small sum of
fifteen bob a-week.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;You have been represented as a very noisy and
turbulent fellow.</p>
<p>SIB.&mdash;Meek as a lamb, my lord, except when I&rsquo;m on the
saw-dust; there I acknowledge, I do crow pretty loudly&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s in the way of business,&mdash;and your lordship knows
that we public jokers must pitch it strong sometimes to make our
audience laugh, and bring the <em>browns</em> into the treasury.
After all, my lord, I am not the rogue many people take me
for,&mdash;more the other way, I can assure you, and</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>&ldquo;Though to my share some human errors fall,</p>
<p>Look in my face, and you&rsquo;ll forget them all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;A strong appeal, I must confess. You shall have
your license.</p>
<p>The successful claimant having made his best bow to Commissioner
Punch, withdrew, whistling the national air of</p>

<p>A fellow named Peel, who has been for many years in the habit of
exhibiting as a quack-doctor, next applied for liberty to vend his
nostrums at the fair. On being questioned as to his qualifications,
he shook his head gravely, and, without uttering a word, placed the
following card in the hands of Punch.</p>
<h6>TO THE GULLIBLE PUBLIC.</h6>

<p>Ben D&rsquo;Israeli, the proprietor of the Learned Pig, applied
for permission to exhibit his animal at the fair. A license was
unhesitatingly granted by his lordship, who rightly considered that
the exhibition of the extraordinary talents of the pig and its
master, would do much to promote a taste for polite literature
amongst the Smithneld &ldquo;pennyboys.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A poor old man, who called himself Sir Francis Burdett, applied
for a license to exhibit his wonderful Dissolving Views. The most
remarkable of which were&mdash;&ldquo;The Hustings in
Covent-garden&mdash;changing to Rous&rsquo;s dinner in
Drury-lane&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;The Patriot in the
Tower&mdash;changing to the Renegade in the Carlton.&rdquo; It
appeared that the applicant was, at one time, in a respectable
business, and kept &ldquo;The Old Glory,&rdquo; a favourite
public-house in Westminster, but, falling into bad company, he lost
his custom and his character, and was reduced to his present
miserable occupation. Punch, in pity for the wretched petitioner,
and fully convinced that his childish tricks were perfectly
harmless, granted him a license to exhibit.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Licenses were also granted to the following persons in the
course of the day:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sir E.L. Bulwer, to exhibit his own portrait, in the character
of Alcibiades, painted by himself.</p>
<p>Doctor Bowring, to exhibit six Tartarian chiefs, caught in the
vicinity of the Seven Dials, with songs, translated from the
original Irish Calmuc, by the Doctor.</p>
<p>Emerson Tennent, to exhibit his wonderful Cosmorama, or views of
anywhere and everywhere; in which the striking features of Ireland,
Greece, Belgium, and Whitechapel will be so happily confounded,
that the spectator may imagine he beholds any or all of these
places at a single glance.</p>
<p>Messrs. Stephens, Heraud, and Co., to exhibit, gratis, a
Syncretic Tragedy, with fireworks and tumbling, according to law,
between the acts; to be followed by a lecture on the Unactable
Drama.</p>

<h3>CAPITAL ILLUSTRATION.</h3>
<p>At the recent <em>fracas</em> in Pall Mall, between Captain
Fitzroy and Mr. Shepherd, the latter, like his predecessor of old,
the &ldquo;Gentle Shepherd,&rdquo; performed sundry vague
evolutions with a silver-mounted cane, and requested Captain
Fitzroy to consider himself horsewhipped. Not entertaining quite so
high an opinion of his adversary&rsquo;s imaginative powers, the
Captain floored the said descendant of gentleness, thereby ably
illustrating the precise difference of the &ldquo;<em>real and

<p><span class="hide">P</span>oor old John&rsquo;s alarm was
succeeded by astonishment, for without speaking a word, Agamemnon
bounced into his bed-chamber. He thought the room the most
miserable-looking room he had ever entered, though the floor was
covered with a thick Turkey carpet, a bright fire was blazing in
the grate, and everything about seemed fashioned for comfort. He
threw himself into an easy chair, and kicking off one of his pumps,
crossed his legs, and rested his elbow on the table. He looked at
his bed&mdash;it was a French one&mdash;a mountain of feathers,
covered with a thick, white Marseilles quilt, and festooned over
with a drapery of rich crimson damask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a four-post to-morrow,&rdquo; growled
Collumpsion; &ldquo;French beds are mean-looking things, after all.
Stuffwell has the fellow-chair to this&mdash;one chair does look
strange! I wonder it has never struck me before; but it is
surprising&mdash;what&mdash;strange ide&mdash;as a
man&mdash;has&rdquo;&mdash;and Collumpsion fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was broad day when Collumpsion awoke; the fire had gone out,
and his feet were as cold as ice. He (as he is married
there&rsquo;s no necessity for concealment)&mdash;he swore two or
three naughty oaths, and taking off his clothes, hurried into bed
in the hope of getting warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How confoundedly cold I am&mdash;sitting in that chair
all night, too&mdash;ridiculous. If I had had a&mdash;I mean, if I
hadn&rsquo;t been alone, that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened; she
would have waked me.&rdquo; <em>She</em>&mdash;what the deuce made
him use the feminine pronoun!</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock he rose and entered his breakfast-room. The
table was laid as usual&mdash;<em>one</em> large cup and saucer,
<em>one</em> plate, <em>one</em> egg-cup, <em>one</em> knife, and
<em>one</em> fork! He did not know wherefore, but he felt to want
the number increased. John brought up a slice of broiled salmon and
<em>one</em> egg. Collumpsion got into a passion, and ordered a
second edition. The morning was rainy, so Collumpsion remained at
home, and employed himself by kicking about the ottoman, and
mentally multiplying all the single articles in his establishment
by two.</p>
<p>The dinner hour arrived, and there was the same singular
provision for one. He rang the bell, and ordered John to furnish
the table for <em>another</em>. John obeyed, though not without
some strong misgiving of his master&rsquo;s sanity, as the edibles
consisted of a sole, a mutton chop, and a partridge. When John left
the room at his master&rsquo;s request, Collumpsion rose and locked
the door. Having placed a chair opposite, he resumed his seat, and
commenced a series of pantomimic gestures, which were strongly
confirmatory of John&rsquo;s suspicions. He seemed to be holding an
inaudible conversation with some invisible being, placing the
choicest portion of the sole in a plate, and seemingly desiring
John to deliver it to the unknown. As John was not there, he placed
it before himself, and commenced daintily and smilingly picking up
very minute particles, as though he were too much delighted to eat.
He then bowed and smiled, and extending his arm, appeared to fill
the opposite glass, and having <em>actually</em> performed the same
operation with his own, he bowed and smiled again, and sipped the
brilliant Xeres. He then rang the bell violently, and unlocking the
door, rushed rapidly back to his chair, as though he were fearful
of committing a rudeness by leaving it. The table being
replenished, and John again dismissed the room, the same pantomime
commenced. The one mutton chop seemed at first to present an
obstacle to the proper conduct of the scene; but gracefully
uncovering the partridge, and as gracefully smiling towards the
invisible, he appeared strongly to recommend the bird in preference
to the beast. Dinner at length concluded, he rose, and apparently
led his phantom guest from the table, and then returning to his
arm-chair, threw himself into it, and, crossing his hands upon his
breast, commenced a careful examination of the cinders and himself.
His rumination ended in a doze, and his doze in a dream, in which
he fancied himself a Brobdignag Java sparrow during the moulting
season. His cage was surrounded by beautiful and blooming girls,
who seemed to pity his condition, and vie with each other in
proposing the means of rendering him more comfortable. Some spoke
of elastic cotton shirts, linsey-wolsey jackets, and silk
nightcaps; others of merino hose, silk feet and cotton tops,
shirt-buttons and warming-pans; whilst Mrs. Greatgirdle and Mrs.
Waddledot sang an echo duet of &ldquo;What a pity the bird is
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;A change came o&rsquo;er the spirit of his
dream.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He thought that the moulting season was over, and that he was
rejoicing in the fulness of a sleeky plumage, and by his side was a
Java sparrowess, chirping and hopping about, rendering the cage as
populous to him as though he were the tenant of a
bird-fancier&rsquo;s shop. Then&mdash;he awoke just as Old John was
finishing a glass of Madeira, preparatory to arousing Collumpsion,
for the purpose of delivering to him a scented note, which had just
been left by the footman of Mrs. Waddledot.</p>
<p>It was lucky for John that A.C.A. had been blessed with pleasant
dreams, or his attachment to Madeira might have occasioned his
discharge from No. 24, Pleasant-terrace.</p>
<p>The note was an invitation to Mrs. Waddledot&rsquo;s opera-box
for that evening. The performance was to be Rossini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;La Cenerentola,&rdquo; and as Collumpsion recollected the
subject of the opera, his heart fluttered in his bosom. A prince
marrying a cinder-sifter for love! What must the happy state
be&mdash;or rather what must it not be&mdash;to provoke such a
condescension!</p>
<p>Collumpsion never appeared to such advantage as he did that
evening; he was dressed to a miracle of perfection&mdash;his
spirits were so elastic that they must have carried him out of the
box into &ldquo;Fop&rsquo;s-alley,&rdquo; had not Mrs. Waddledot
cleverly surrounded him by the detachment from the corps of
eighteen daughters, which had (on that night) been placed under her
command.</p>
<p>Collumpsion&rsquo;s state of mind did not escape the notice of
the fair campaigners, and the most favourable deductions were drawn
from it in relation to the charitable combination which they had
formed for his ultimate good, and all seemed determined to afford
him every encouragement in their power. Every witticism that he
uttered elicited countless smiles&mdash;every criticism that he
delivered was universally applauded&mdash;in short, Agamemnon
Collumpsion Applebite was voted the most delightful beau in the
universe, and Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite gave himself a
plumper to the same opinion.</p>
<p>On the 31st of the following month, a string of carriages
surrounded St. George&rsquo;s Church, Hanover-square, and precisely
at a quarter to twelve, A.M., Agamemnon Collumpsion Applebite
placed a plain gold ring on the finger of Miss Juliana Theresa
Waddledot, being a necessary preliminary to the introduction of our
hero, the &ldquo;Heir of Applebite.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SHALL GREAT OLYMPUS TO A MOLEHILL STOOP?</h3>
<p>Some difficulty has arisen as to the production of
Knowles&rsquo;s new play at the Haymarket Theatre. Mr. Charles Kean
and Miss Helen Faucit having objected to hear the play read,
&ldquo;<em>because their respective parts had not been previously
submitted to them.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Sunday
Times</em>.&mdash;[We are of opinion that they were decidedly
right. One might as well expect a child to spell without learning
the alphabet, as either of the above persons to understand Knowles,
unless enlightened by a long course of previous instruction.]</p>

<h2>THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p class="cen">[From a MS. drama called the &ldquo;COURT OF
VICTORIA.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cen"><em>Scene in Windsor Castle.</em></p>
<p class="cen">[<em>Her Majesty discovered sitting thoughtfully at
an escrutoire.</em>&mdash;</p>
<p class="cen"><em>Enter the</em> LORD CHAMBERLAIN.]</p>
<p>LORD CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;May it please your Majesty, a letter
from the Duke of Wellington.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN (<em>opens the letter</em>.)&mdash;Oh! a person for
the vacant place of Premier&mdash;show the bearer in, my lord.
[<em>Exit</em> LORD CHAMBERLAIN.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN (<em>muses</em>).&mdash;Sir Robert Peel&mdash;I have
heard that name before, as connected with my family. If I remember
rightly, he held the situation of adviser to the crown in the reign
of Uncle William, and was discharged for exacting a large discount
on all the state receipts; yet Wellington is very much interested
in his favour.</p>
<p class="cen"><em>Enter the</em> LORD CHAMBERLAIN, <em>who ushers
in</em> SIR ROBERT, <em>and then retires. As he is
going</em>&mdash;]</p>
<p>LORD CHAMBERLAIN (<em>aside</em>).&mdash;If you do get the
berth, Sir Robert, I hope you&rsquo;ll not give me warning.</p>
<p class="rgt">[<em>Exit</em>.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT (<em>looking demurely</em>).&mdash;Hem!</p>
<p class="cen">[<em>The Queen regards him very
attentively.</em>]</p>
<p>THE QUEEN (<em>aside</em>).&mdash;I don&rsquo;t much like the
looks of the fellow&mdash;that affectation of simplicity is
evidently intended to conceal the real cunning of his character.
(<em>Aloud</em>). You are of course aware of the nature and the
duties of the situation which you solicit?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Oh, yes, your Majesty; I have filled it
before, and liked it very much.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;It&rsquo;s a most responsible post, for upon
your conduct much of the happiness of my other servants
depends.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;I am aware of that, your Majesty; but as no
one can hope to please everybody, I will only answer that <em>one
half</em> shall be perfectly satisfied.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;You have recently returned from Tamworth?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Yes, your Majesty.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;We will dispense with forms. At Tamworth, you
have been practising as a quack doctor?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Yes, madam; I was brought up to doctoring, and
am a professor of sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;What have you done in the latter art to entitle
you to such a distinction?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;I have performed some very wonderful changes.
When I was out of place, I had opinions strongly opposed to
Catholic emancipation; but when I got into service I changed them
in the course of a few days.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;I have heard that you boast of possessing a
nostrum for the restoration of the public good. What is it?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Am I to consider myself &ldquo;as regularly
called in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;That is a question I decline answering at
present.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Then I regret that I must also remain
silent.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN (<em>aside</em>).&mdash;The wily fox!
(<em>aloud</em>)&mdash;Are you aware that great distress exists in
the country?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Oh, yes! I have heard that there are several
families who keep no man-servant, and that numerous clerks,
weavers, and other artisans, occupy second-floors.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;I have heard that the people are wanting
bread.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Ha, ha! that was from the late premier, I
suppose. He merely forgot an adjective&mdash;it is <em>cheap</em>
bread that the people are clamouring for.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;And why can they not have it?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;I have consulted with the Duke of Richmond
upon the subject, and he says it is impossible.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;But why?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Wheat must be lower before bread can be
cheaper.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Well!</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;And rents must be less if that is the case,
and&mdash;</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Well!</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;And that the landowners won&rsquo;t agree
to.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Well!</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;And, then, I can&rsquo;t keep my place a
day.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Then the majority of my subjects are to be
rendered miserable for the advantage of the few?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;That&rsquo;s the principle of all good
governments. Besides, cheap bread would be no benefit to the
masses, for wages would be lower.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Do you really believe such <em>would</em> be
the case?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Am I regularly called in?</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;You evade a direct answer, I see. Granting such
to be <em>your belief</em>, your friends and landowners would
suffer no injury, for their incomes would procure them as many
luxuries.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Not if they were to live abroad, or patronise
foreign manufactures: and <em>should</em> wages be higher, what
would they say to me after all the money they have expended in
bri&mdash;I mean at the Carlton Club, if I allow the value of their
&ldquo;dirty acres&rdquo; to be reduced.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Pray, what do you call such views?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Patriotism.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Charity would be a better term, as that is said
to begin at home. How long were you in your last place?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Not half so long as I wished&mdash;for the
sake of the country.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Why did you leave?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Somebody said I was saucy&mdash;and somebody
else said I was not honest&mdash;and somebody else said I had
better go.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Who was the latter somebody?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;My master.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Your exposure of my late premier&rsquo;s
faults, and your present application for his situation, result from
disinterestedness, of course?</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Of course, madam.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Then salary is not so much an object as a
comfortable situation.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;I beg pardon; but I&rsquo;ve been out of place
ten years, and have a small family to support. <em>Wages</em> is,
therefore, some sort of a consideration.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite like you.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT (<em>glancing knowingly at the Queen</em>).&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think there is any one that <em>you can</em> have
better.</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid not.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT.&mdash;Then, am I regularly called in?</p>
<p>THE QUEEN.&mdash;Yes, you can take your boxes to
Downing-street.</p>

<p>The Earl of Coventry intends suggesting, that every member of
both Houses be immediately supplied with a copy of the work called
&ldquo;Ten Minutes&rsquo; Advice on Corns,&rdquo; in order to

<div class="stanza">
<p>When the Whig Ministry had run,</p>
<p>Nor left behind a mother&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p>The Tories, at their leader&rsquo;s call,</p>
<p>Came thronging round him, one and all,</p>
<p>Exulting, braying, cringing, coaxing,</p>
<p>Expert at humbugging and hoaxing;</p>
<p>By turns they felt an <em>honest</em> zeal</p>
<p>For private good and public weal;</p>
<p>Till all at once they raised such yells,</p>
<p>As rung in Apsley House the bells:</p>
<p>And as they sought snug berths to get</p>
<p>In Bobby Peel&rsquo;s new cabinet,</p>
<p>Each, for interest ruled the hour,</p>

<p class="i2">Of Lyndhurst&rsquo;s angry scowl afraid.</p>

<p>With woeful visage Melbourne sate&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A pint of double X his grief beguiled;</p>

<p class="i2">He call&rsquo;d on Bobby still through all the

<p>But ever as his sweetest theme he chose,</p>
<p>A sovereign&rsquo;s golden chink was heard at every close,</p>

<p>During the clear-out on Wednesday last in Downing-street, a
small chest, strongly secured, was found among some models of

<h2>THE LOST MEDICAL PAPERS OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is somewhat remarkable,&rdquo; observe the journals of
the past week, &ldquo;that the medical division of this scientific
meeting has not contributed one single paper this year in
furtherance of its object, although the communications from that
section have usually been of a highly important
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journals may think it somewhat remarkable&mdash;we do not at
all; for here, as in every other event of the day, a great deal
depends upon being &ldquo;behind the curtain;&rdquo; and as the
greater portion of our life is passed in that locality, we are
always to be relied upon for authenticity in our statements. The
plain truth is, that the papers were inadvertently lost, and rather
than lead to some unpleasant disclosures, in which the eminent
professor to whom they were entrusted would have been deeply
implicated, it was thought best to say nothing about them. By
chance they fell into the hands of the manager of one of our
perambulating theatres, who was toiling his way from the west of
England to Egham races, and having deposited them in his portable
green-room, under the especial custody of the clown, the doctor,
and the overbearing parochial authority, he duly remitted them to
our office. We have been too happy in giving them a place in our
columns, feeling an honest pride in thus taking the lead of the
chief scientific publications of the day. It will be seen that they
are drawn up as a report, all ready for publication, according to
the usual custom of such proceedings, where every one knows
beforehand what they are to dispute or agree with.</p>
<p>Dr. Splitnerve communicated a remarkable case of Animal
Magnetism:&mdash;Eugene Doldrum, aged 21, a young man of bilious
and interesting temperament, having been mesmerized, was rendered
so keenly magnetic, as to give rise to a most remarkable train of
phenomena. On being seated upon a music-stool, he immediately
becomes an animated compass, and turns round to the north. Knives
and forks at dinner invariably fly towards him, and he is not able
to go through any of the squares, in consequence of being attracted
firmly to the iron railings. As most of the experiments took place
at the North London Hospital, Euston-square was his chief point of
attraction, and when he was removed, it was always found necessary
to break off the railings and take them away with him. This
accounted for the decrepit condition of the <em>fleur de lys</em>
that surround the inclosure, which was not, as generally supposed,
the work of the university pupils residing in Gower-place. Perfect
insensibility to pain supervened at the same time, and his friends
took advantage of this circumstance to send him, by way of delicate
compliment, to a lying-in lady, in the style of a pedestrian
pin-cushion, his cheeks being stuck full of minikin pins, on the
right side, forming the words &ldquo;Health to the Babe,&rdquo; and
on the left, &ldquo;Happiness to the Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Mortar read a talented paper on the cure of strabismus, or
squinting, by dividing the muscles of the eye. The patient, a
working man, squinted so terribly, that his eyes almost got into
one another&rsquo;s sockets; and at times he was only able to see
by looking down the inside of his nose and out at the nostrils. The
operation was performed six weeks ago, when, on cutting through the
muscles, its effects were instantly visible: both the eyes
immediately diverging to the extreme outer angles of their
respective orbits.</p>
<p>Dr. Sharpeye inquired if the man did not find the present state
of his vision still very perplexing.</p>
<p>Dr. Mortar replied, that so far from injuring his sight, it had
proved highly beneficial, as the patient had procured a very
excellent situation in the new police, and received a double
salary, from the power he possessed of keeping an eye upon both
sides of the road at the same time.</p>

<p>An elaborate and highly scientific treatise was then read by Dr.
Sexton, upon a disease which had been very prevalent in town during
the spring, and had been usually termed the influenza. He defined
it as a disease of convenience, depending upon various exciting
causes acting upon the mind. For instance:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, a lady residing in Belgrave-square, was on
the eve of giving a large party, when, upon hearing that Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash; had made an unlucky speculation in the funds, the
whole family were seized with influenza so violently, that they
were compelled to postpone the reunion, and live upon the provided
supper for a fortnight afterwards.</p>
<p>Miss B&mdash;&mdash; was a singer at one of our large theatres,
and had a part assigned to her in a new opera. Not liking it, she
worried herself into an access of influenza, which unluckily seized
her the first night the opera was to have been played.</p>
<p>But the most marked case was that of Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, a
clerk in a city house of business, who was attacked and cured
within three days. It appeared that he had been dining that
afternoon with some friends, who were going to Greenwich fair the
next day, and on arriving at home, was taken ill with influenza, so
suddenly that he was obliged to despatch a note to that effect to
his employer, stating also his fear that he should be unable to
attend at his office on the morrow. Dr. Sexton said he was indebted
for an account of the progress of his disease to a young medical
gentleman, clinical clerk at a leading hospital, who lodged with
the patient in Bartholomew-close. The report had been drawn up for
the <em>Lancet</em>, but Dr. S. had procured it by great
interest.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>MAY 30, 1841, 11 P.M.&mdash;Present symptoms:&mdash;Complains of
his employer, and the bore of being obliged to be at the office
next morning. Has just eaten a piece of cold beef and pickles, with
a pint of stout. Pulse about 75, and considerable defluxion from
the nose, which he thinks produced by getting a piece of Cayenne
pepper in his eye. Swallowed a crumb, which brought on a violent
fit of coughing. Wishes to go to bed.</p>
<p>MAY 31, 9 A.M.&mdash;Has passed a tolerable night, but appears
restless, and unable to settle to anything. Thinks he could eat
some broiled ham if he had it; but not possessing any, has taken
the following:</p>

<p>A plaster ordered to be applied to the inside of the stomach,
consisting of potted bloater spread upon bread and butter.</p>
<p>Eleven, A.M.&mdash;Appears rather hotter since breakfast. Change
of air recommended, and Greenwich decided upon.</p>
<p>Half-past 11.&mdash;Complains of the draught and noise of the
second-class railway carriages, but is otherwise not worse. Thinks
he should like &ldquo;a drain of half-and-half.&rdquo; Has blown
his nose once in the last quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Two, P.M.&mdash;Since a light dinner of rump steaks and stout, a
considerable change has taken place. He appears labouring under
cerebral excitement and short pipes, and says he shall have a
regular beanish day, and go it similar to bricks. Calls the waiter
up to him in one of the booths, and has ordered &ldquo;a glass of
cocktail with the chill off and a cinder in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three, P.M.&mdash;Has sallied out into the fair, still much
excited, calling every female he meets &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; and
pronouncing the s&rsquo;s with a whistling accent. Expresses a
desire to ride in the ships that go round and round.</p>
<p>Half-past 3.&mdash;The motion of the ships has tended
considerably to relieve his stomach. Pulse slow and countenance
pale, with a desire for a glass of ale. Has entered a peepshow, and
is now arguing with the exhibitor upon the correctness of his view
of the siege of &ldquo;St. Jane Daker!&rdquo; which he maintains
was a sea-port, and not a field with a burning windmill, as
represented in the view.</p>
<p>Eight, P.M.&mdash;After rambling vaguely about the fair all the
afternoon, he has decided upon taking a hot-air bath in
Algar&rsquo;s Crown and Anchor booth. Evidently delirious. Has put
on a false nose, and purchased a tear-coat rattle. Appears
labouring under violent spasmodic action of the muscles of his
legs, as he dances &ldquo;Jim along Josey,&rdquo; when he sets to
his partner in a country dance of eighty couple.</p>
<p>Half-past 10, P.M.&mdash;Has just intimated that he does not see
the use of going home, as you can always go there when you can go
nowhere else. Is seated straddling across one of the tables, on
which he is beating time to the band with a hooky stick. Will not
allow the state of his pulse to be ascertained, but says we may
feel his fist if we like.</p>
<p>Eleven.&mdash;Considerable difficulty experienced in getting the
patient to the railroad, but we at last succeeded. After telling
every one in the carriage &ldquo;that he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of any
of them,&rdquo; he fell into a deep stertorous sleep. On arriving
at home, he got into bed with his boots on, and passed a restless
night, turning out twice to drink water between one and four.</p>
<p>JUNE.&mdash;10, A.M.&mdash;Has just returned from his office,
his employer thinking him very unfit for work, and desiring him to
lay up for a day or two. Complains of being &ldquo;jolly
seedy,&rdquo; and thinks he shall go to Greenwich again to get all
right.</p>
</div>
<p>A thrilling paper upon the &ldquo;Philosophy of death,&rdquo;
was then read by Professor Wynne Slow. After tracing the origin of
that fatal attack, which it appears the earliest nations were
subject to, the learned author showed profound research in bringing
forward the various terms applied to the act of dying by popular
authors. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>[pg
95]</span>Amongst the principal, he enumerated &ldquo;turning your
toes up,&rdquo; &ldquo;kicking the bucket,&rdquo; &ldquo;putting up
your spoon,&rdquo; &ldquo;slipping your wind,&rdquo; &ldquo;booking
your place,&rdquo; &ldquo;breaking your bellows,&rdquo;
&ldquo;shutting up your shop,&rdquo; and other phrases full of
expression.</p>
<p>The last moments of remarkable characters were especially dwelt
upon, in connexion, more especially, with the drama, which gives us
the best examples, from its holding a mirror up to nature. It
appeared that at Astley&rsquo;s late amphitheatre, the dying men
generally shuffled about a great deal in the sawdust, fighting on
their knees, and showing great determination to the last, until
life gave way; that at the Adelphi the expiring character more
frequently saw imaginary demons waiting for him, and fell down,
uttering &ldquo;Off, fiends! I come to join you in your world of
flames!&rdquo; and that clowns and pantaloons always gave up the
ghost with heart-rending screams and contortions of visage, as
their deaths were generally violent, from being sawn in half,
having holes drilled in them with enormous gimlets, or being shot
out of cannon; but that, at the same time, these deaths were not
permanent.</p>
<hr />
<h3>FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>Our foreign expresses have reached us <em>via</em> Billingsgate,
and are full of interesting matter. Captain Fitz-Flammer is in
prison at Boulogne, for some trifling misunderstanding with a
native butcher, about the settlement of an account; but we trust no
time will be lost by our government in demanding his release at the
hands of the authorities. The attempt to make it a private question
is absurd; and every Englishman&rsquo;s blood will simmer, if it
does not actually boil, at the intelligence. Fitz-Flammer was only
engaged in doing that which many of our countrymen visit Boulogne
expressly to do, and it is hard that he should have been
intercepted in his retreat, after accomplishing his object. To live
at the expense of a natural enemy is certainly a bold and patriotic
act, which ought to excite sympathy at home, and protection abroad.
The English packet, the <em>City of Boulogne</em>, has turned one
of its imitation guns directly towards the town, which, we trust,
will have the effect of bringing the French authorities to
reason.</p>
<p>It is expected that the treaty will shortly be signed, by which
Belgium cedes to France a milestone on the north frontier; while
the latter country returns to the former the whole of the territory
lying behind a pig-stye, taken possession of in the celebrated 6th
<em>vendemiaire</em>, by the allied armies. This will put an end to
the heart-burnings that have long existed on either side of the
Rhine, and will serve to apply the sponge at once to a long score
of national animosities.</p>
<p>Our letters from the East are far from encouraging. The Pasha
has had a severe sore-throat, and the disaffected have taken
advantage of the circumstance. Ibrahim had spent the two last
nights in the mountains, and was unfurling his standard, when our
express left, in the very bosom of the desert. Mehemet Ali was
still obstinate, and had dismissed his visier for impertinence. The
whole of Servia is in a state of revolt, and the authorities have
planted troops along the entire line, the whole of whom have gone
over to the enemy. It is said there must be further concessions,
and a new constitution is being drawn up; but it is not expected
that any one will abide by it. Mehemet attempted to throw himself
upon the rock of Nungab, with a tremendous force, but those about
him wisely prevented him from doing so.</p>
<p>We have received China (tea) papers to the 16th. There is
nothing in them.</p>
<hr />
<h3>FANCIED FAIR.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Wellington,&rdquo; says a correspondent of
the <em>Times</em>, &ldquo;left his umbrella behind him at a fancy
fair, held for charitable purposes, between Twickenham and
Teddington. On discovering it, Lady P. immediately said, &lsquo;Who
will give twenty guineas for the Duke&rsquo;s umbrella?&rsquo; A
purchaser was soon found; and when the fact was communicated to his
Grace, he good-naturedly remarked, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon supply
you with umbrellas, if you can sell them with so much advantage to
the charity.&rsquo;&rdquo; We trust his Grace&rsquo;s benevolent
disposition will not induce him to carry this offer into execution.
We should extremely regret to see the Hero of Waterloo in
Leicester-square, of a rainy night, vending second-hand
<em>parapluies</em>. The same charitable impulse will doubtlessly
induce other fashionable hawkers at fancy fairs to pick his
Grace&rsquo;s pockets. We are somewhat curious to know what a
Wellington bandana would realise, especially were it the produce of
some pretty lady P.&rsquo;s petty larceny. &ldquo;Charity,&rdquo;
it is said, &ldquo;covereth a multitude of sins.&rdquo; What must
it do with an umbrella? We fear that Lady P. will some day figure
in the &ldquo;fashionable departures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FOR SYDNEY DIRECT.</p>
</div>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>MARTINUZZI AS THE ACT DIRECTS.</h3>
<p>The production upon the stage of a tragedy &ldquo;not intended
for an acting play,&rdquo; as a broad travestie, is a novel and
dangerous experiment&mdash;one, however, which the combined genius
of the Dramatic Authors&rsquo; Council has made, with the utmost
success. The &ldquo;Hungarian Daughter&rdquo; was, under the title
of &ldquo;Martinuzzi,&rdquo; received, on its first appearance,
with bursts of applause and convulsions of laughter!</p>
<p>The plot of this piece our literary reviewer has expressed
himself unable to unravel. We are in the same condition; all we can
promise is some account of the scenes as they followed each other;
of the characters, the sentiments, the poetry, and the rest of the
fun.</p>
<p>The play opens with an elderly gentleman, in a spangled
dressing-gown, who commences business by telling us the time of
day, poetically clapping a wig upon the sun, by saying, he</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Shakes day about, like perfume from his
<em>hair</em>,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which statement bears out the after sentence, that &ldquo;the
wisdom he endures is terrible!&rdquo; An Austrian
gentleman&mdash;whose dress made us at first mistake him for
Richard III. on his travels&mdash;arrives to inform the gentleman
<em>en d&eacute;shabille</em>&mdash;no other than <em>Cardinal
Martinuzzi</em> himself&mdash;that he has come from King Ferdinand,
to ask if he will be so good as to give up some regency; which the
Cardinal, however, respectfully declines doing. A gentleman from
Warsaw is next announced, and <em>Castaldo</em> retires, having
incidentally declared a passion for the reigning queen of
Hungary.</p>
<p>Mr. Selby, as <em>Rupert</em> from Warsaw, then appears, in a
dress most correctly copied from the costume of the knave of clubs.
Being a Pole, he stirs up the Cardinal vigorously enough to provoke
some exceedingly intemperate language, chiefly by bringing to his
memory a case of child-stealing, to which <em>Martinuzzi</em> was,
before he had quite sown his wild oats, <em>particeps
criminis</em>. This case having got into the papers (which
<em>Rupert</em> had preserved), the Cardinal wants to obtain them,
but offers a price not long enough for the Pole, who, declaring
that <em>Martinuzzi</em> carries it &ldquo;too high&rdquo; to be
trusted with them, vanishes. Mr. Morley afterwards comes forward to
sing a song according to Act of Parliament, and the scene changes
for Miss Collect to comply, a second time, with the 25th of George
II.</p>
<p>In the following scene, the Queen Dowager of Hungary,
<em>Isabella</em>, introduces herself to the audience, to inform
them that the Austrian gentleman, <em>Castaldo</em>, is</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">&ldquo;the mild,</p>
<p>Pity-fraught object of her fondness.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He appears. She makes several inflammatory speeches, which he
seems determined not to understand, for he is in love with the
virgin queen; and maidens before dowagers is evidently his sensible
motto.</p>
<p>The second act opens with the queen junior stating her
assurance, that if she lives much longer she will die, and that
when she is quite dead, she will hate
<em>Martinuzzi</em><sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote">3.
&ldquo;<em>Czerina.</em> When I am dead&mdash;which will be
soon&mdash;I feel,<br />
If I much longer on my throne remain,<br />
I shall abhor the name of Martinuzzi.&rdquo;</span>. As, however,
she means to hate when she is deceased, she will make the most of
her time while alive, by devoting herself to courtship and
<em>Castaldo</em>: for a very tender love-scene ensues, at the end
of which the lady elopes, to leave the lover a clear stage for some
half-dozen minutes&rsquo; ecstatics, appropriately ended by his
arrest, ordered by <em>Martinuzzi</em>. Why, it is not stated, the
officer not even producing the copy of a writ.</p>
<p>In the next scene, <em>Isabella</em> is visited by
<em>Rupert</em>, who disinterestedly presents the dowager with the
papers for nothing, which he was before offered an odd castle and
snug estate for, by <em>Martinuzzi</em>. This is accounted for on
no other supposition, than the proverbial gallantry of gentlemen
from Warsaw.</p>
<p><em>Martinuzzi</em>, possessing a ward whom he is anxious should
wed the queen, opens the third act by declaring he will
&ldquo;precipitate the match,&rdquo; and so the author
considerately sends <em>Czerina</em> to him, to talk the matter
over. But the young lady gets into a passion, and the Cardinal
declares he can make nothing of her, in the following
passage:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Fool! I can make thee nothing but a laugh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A sentiment to which the audience gave a most vociferous echo.
The damsel is angry that she may not have the man she has chosen,
and threatens to faint, but defers that operation till her
lover&rsquo;s arms are near enough to receive her; which they
happen to be just in time, for <em>Martinuzzi</em> retires and
<em>Castaldo</em> comes on. <em>Czerina</em>, to be quite sure,
exclaims, &ldquo;<em>Are</em> these thy arms?&rdquo; (<em>sic</em>)
and finally faints in the lover&rsquo;s embrace, so as to exhibit a
picturesque cuddle.</p>
<p><em>Queen Isabella</em> is discovered, in the second scene of
this act, perusing the much vaunted &ldquo;papers&rdquo; with
intense interest. Unluckily <em>Castaldo</em> chooses that moment
to complain, that <em>Martinuzzi</em> will not let him marry her
rival. The queen, being by no means a temperate person, and
wondering at his impudence in telling <em>her</em> such a tale,
raves thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;My soul&rsquo;s on fire I&rsquo;m choked, and seem to
perish;</p>
<p><em>But will suppress my scream</em>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Probably for fear of compromising <em>Castaldo</em>, who is
alone with her; and she ends the act by requesting the Austrian to
murder <em>Martinuzzi</em>; to which he is so obliging as to
consent, the more so, as an order comes from the Secretary of State
for foreign affairs, of his own government, to &ldquo;cut
off&rdquo; (<em>sic</em>) the Regent.</p>
<p>The fourth act is enlivened by a masquerade and a murder. The
gentleman from Warsaw having abused the hospitality of his host by
getting drunk, is punished by one of <em>Martinuzzi&rsquo;s</em>
attendants with a mortal stab; and having, in the agonies of death,
made a careful survey of all the sofas in the apartment, suits
himself with the softest, and dies in great comfort.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>[pg
96]</span>
<p>After this, the masquerade proceeds with spirit.
<em>Isabella</em> mixes in the festive scene, disguised in a
domino, made of black sticking-plaster. <em>Czerina</em> overhears
that she is a usurper and a changeling, and expresses her surprise
in a line most unblushingly stolen from Fitz-Ball and the other
poetico-melo-dramatists:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heavens! do my ears deceive me?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The festivities conclude with an altercation between
<em>Martinuzzi</em> and <em>Isabella</em>, carried on with much
vigour on both sides. The lady accuses the gentleman of
inebriation, and he owns the soft impeachment, fully bearing it out
by several incoherent speeches.</p>
<p>This was one of the most successful scenes in the comedy. The
death of <em>Rupert</em>, Mr. Morley&rsquo;s song about &ldquo;The
sea,&rdquo; the quarrel (which was about the great pivot of the
plot, &ldquo;the papers,&rdquo; inscribed, says
<em>Martinuzzi</em>,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;With ink that&rsquo;s <em>brew&rsquo;d</em> in the
infernal Styx,&rdquo;)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>were all received with uproarious bursts of laughter.</p>
<p>In the fifth act, we behold <em>Martinuzzi</em> and the usurping
young Queen making matters up at a railway pace. She has it all her
own way. If she choose, she may marry <em>Castaldo</em>, retire
into private life, be a &ldquo;farm-house thrall,&rdquo; and keep a
&ldquo;dairy;&rdquo; for which estate she has previously expressed
a decided predilection<sup>4</sup><span class="sidenote">4. Acting
play, published in the theatre, p. 32.</span>.</p>
<p>But it is the next scene that the author seems to have reserved
for putting forth his strongest powers of burlesque and broad
humour. <em>Isabella</em> and <em>Castaldo</em> are together; the
latter feels a little afraid to murder <em>Martinuzzi</em>, but is
impelled to the deed by a thousand imaginary torches, which he
fears will hurry his &ldquo;<em>moth</em>-like soul&rdquo; into
their &ldquo;blinding sun-beams,&rdquo; till it (the soul) is
scorched &ldquo;<em>into</em> cinders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Castaldo</em> appears, in truth, a very bad barber of
murders; for, as he is rushing out to</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Strike the tyrant down&mdash;in crimson streams</p>
<p>Rend every nerve,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Isabella</em> has the shrewdness to discover that he is
without a weapon. Important omission! The incipient assassin
exclaims&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that I had my sword!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but at that moment (clever, dramatic contrivance!)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>[<em>Enter</em> CZERINA, <em>with a drawn sword</em>.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;CZERINA. There&rsquo;s one! Thine own!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Far from being grateful for this opportune supply of ways and
means for murder. <em>Castaldo</em> calls the bilbo a &ldquo;fated
aspic,&rdquo; upon the edge of which his &ldquo;eye-balls crack to
look,&rdquo; and makes a raving exit from the stage, to a roaring
laugh from the audience.</p>
<p>It is quite clear to <em>Isabella</em>, from his extreme
carelessness about his tools, that <em>Castaldo</em> is not safely
to be trusted with a job which requires so much tact and
business-like exactitude as the capital offence. She therefore
&ldquo;<em>shows a phial</em>,&rdquo; which she intends,
&ldquo;occasion suiting,&rdquo; for
&ldquo;<em>Martinuzzi&rsquo;s</em> bane;&rdquo; thereby hinting
that, if <em>Castaldo</em> fail with his steel medicine, she is
ready with a surer potion.</p>
<p>The next scene, being the last, was ushered in with
acclamations. The stage, as is always in that case made and
provided, was full. There is a young gentleman on a throne, and
<em>Czerina</em> beside it, having been somehow ungallantly
deposed. <em>Martinuzzi</em> expresses a wish to drink
somebody&rsquo;s health, and this being the &ldquo;fitting
opportunity&rdquo; mentioned by the author in the scene preceeding,
<em>Isabella</em> empties the phial of her wrath into the beverage,
and the <em>Cardinal</em> quenches his thirst with a most
intemperate draught. It is now duly announced, that
<em>Castaldo</em> is, &ldquo;with naked sword, approaching.&rdquo;
That gentleman appears, and makes a speech long enough for any man
who has had such plain warning of what is to happen&mdash;even a
cardinal encumbered with a spangled dressing-gown&mdash;to get a
mile out of his way. The speech quite ended, he goes to work, and
with &ldquo;this from King Ferdinand,&rdquo; thrusts at
<em>Martinuzzi</em>. <em>Czerina</em>, however, throws herself,
with great skill, on the point of the sword, and dies. Another long
harangue from <em>Castaldo</em>&mdash;which, as he is evidently
broken-winded from exertion, is pronounced in tiny
snatches&mdash;and he dies with a &ldquo;ha!&rdquo; for
want&mdash;like many greater men&mdash;of breath.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the poison makes <em>Martinuzzi</em> exceedingly
uncomfortable in the stomachic regions. He is quite sure</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;That hath been done to me which sends me
<em>star</em>-ward!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but in his progress thither he evidently loses his way; for he
ends the play by inquiring&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;WHERE IS THE WORLD?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sublimity of which query is manifestly insisted on by the
author, by his having it printed in capitals.</p>
<p>When the curtain fell, there arose an uproarious shout for the
author; but instead of &ldquo;the mantle of the Elizabethan
poets,&rdquo; which, it has been said, he commonly wears, the most
attractive garment that met the view was an expansive white
waistcoat. This latter exhibition concluded the entertainments,
strictly so called; for though a farce followed, it turned out a
terrible bore.</p>
<hr />
<h3>CONCERTS D&rsquo;ETE.</h3>
<p>If the advance of musical science is to be effected by indecent
<em>tableaux vivans</em>&mdash;by rattling peas against sieves, and
putting out the lights (appropriately enough) when Beethoven is
being murdered&mdash;by the most contemptible class of compositions
that ever was put upon score-paper, and noised forth from an
ill-disciplined band&mdash;if these be the means towards improving
musical taste, Monsieur Jullien is undoubtedly the harmonic
regenerator of this country. He is a great man&mdash;great in his
own estimation&mdash;great to the ends of his moustachios and the
tips of his gloves&mdash;a great composer, and a great
charlatan&mdash;<em>ex. gr.</em>:&mdash;</p>
<p>The overture to the promenade concerts usually consists of a
pantomime entirely new to an English audience. Monsieur Jullien
having made his appearance in the orchestra, seats himself in a
conspicuous situation, to indulge the ladies with the most
favourable view of his elegant person, and the splendid
gold-chainery which is spread all over his magnificent waistcoat. A
servant in livery then appears, and presents him with a pair of
white kid gloves. The illustrious conductor, having taken some time
to thrust them upon a very large and red hand, leisurely takes up
his baton, rises, grins upon the expectant musicians, lifts his
arm, and&mdash;the first chord is struck!</p>
<p>Quadrilles are the staple of the evening&mdash;those composed by
Monsieur Jullien always, of course, claiming precedence and
preference. These are usually interspersed with solos on the
flageolet, to contrast with <em>obligati</em> for the ophecleido;
the drummers&mdash;side, long, and double&mdash;are seldom
inactive; the trombones and trumpets have no sinecure, and there is
always a great mortality amongst the fiddle-strings. Eight bars of
impossible variation is sure to be succeeded by sixteen of the
deafening fanfare of trumpets, combined with smashing cymbalism,
and dreadful drumming.</p>
<p>The public have a taste for headaches, and Jullien has imported
a capital recipe for creating them; they applaud&mdash;he bows; and
musical taste goes&mdash;in compliment to the ex-waiter&rsquo;s
genuine profession of man-cook&mdash;to <em>pot</em>.</p>
<p>But the <em>ci-devant cuisinier</em> is not content with
comparatively harmless, plain-sailing humbug; he must add some
<em>sauce piquante</em> to his musical hashes. He cannot rest with
merely stunning English ears, but must shock our morals, At the
<em>bals masqu&eacute;s</em>, the French dancers, and the hardly
mentionable <em>cancan</em>, were hooted back to their native stews
under the Palais Royal; but he provides substitutes for them in the
<em>tableaux vivans</em> now exhibiting. This, because a more
insidious, is a safer introduction. The living figures are dressed
to imitate plaster-of-Paris, and are so arranged as to form groups,
called in the bills &ldquo;classical;&rdquo; but for which it would
be difficult to find originals. In short, the whole thing is a
feeler thrown out to see how far French impudence and French
epicureanism in vice may carry themselves. It shall not be our
fault if they do not experience an ignominious downfall, and beat a
speedy retreat, to the tune of the &ldquo;Rogue&rsquo;s
March,&rdquo; arranged as a quadrille!</p>

<h3>MADAME TUSSAUD&rsquo;S,</h3>
<h4>THE REAL TEMPLE OF FAME.</h4>
<div class="note">
<p>&ldquo;Some men are born to greatness, some men achieve
greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon
them.&rdquo;&mdash;SHAKSPEARE.</p>
</div>
<p>Reader, should you doubt the above assertion, in the true
showman phraseology, just &ldquo;Walk up! walk up!&rdquo; to Madame
Tussaud&rsquo;s, the real Temple of Fame, and let such doubts
vanish for ever; convince yourselves that the mighty attribute not
more survives from good than evil deeds, though, like poverty, it
makes its votaries acquainted with the strangest of strange
bedfellows! The regal ermine and the murderer&rsquo;s fustian alike
obtain their enviable niche.</p>
<p>The likeness of departed majesty, robed in the matchless
splendour of a ruler&rsquo;s state, redolent with all the mimic
glories of a king&rsquo;s insignia, the modelled puppet from the
senseless clay, that wore in life the imperial purple, and moved a
breathing thing, chief actor in its childish mummeries, may here be
seen shining in tinselled pomp, in glittering contrast to the
blood-stained shirt through which the dagger of Ravaillac reached
the bosom of the murdered Henry.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Real Robes&rdquo; of the dead George give value to
his waxen image! The heart&rsquo;s-blood of the slaughtered Henry
immortalises the linen bearing its hideous stain. The daring leader
of France&rsquo;s countless hosts&mdash;the wholesale slaughterer
of unnumbered thousands&mdash;ambition&rsquo;s mightiest
son&mdash;now ruling kingdoms and now ruled by one&mdash;once more
than king&mdash;in death the captive of his hated
foes&mdash;&ldquo;the great Napoleon!&rdquo; shares the small space
with the enshrined Fieschi!</p>
<p>The glorious triumphs of the mighty Wellington are here no
better passports than the foul murders of the atrocious Burke; the
subtle Talleyrand, the deep deviser of political schemes, ruler of
rulers, and master mover of the earth&rsquo;s great puppets, is not
one jot superior to the Italian mountebank, whose well-skilled hand
drew tones from catgut rivalling even the ideal trumpet of great
Fame herself!</p>
<p>By some strange anomaly, <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em>
alike render the candidates admissible&mdash;no matter the
littleness of the source from whence they sprung. Lord
Melbourne&rsquo;s &ldquo;premiership&rdquo; gave shape to the all
but Promethean wax. The failure of John Frost, his humble follower,
secured his right to Fame&rsquo;s posthumous honours. All
partiality is <em>here</em> forgotten. The titled premier, in the
haunts of men, may boast his monarch&rsquo;s palace as his home.
The suffering felon, though <em>iron</em> binds his limbs, and eats
into his heart&mdash;though slow approaching, but sure-coming
death, makes the broad world for him a living grave, <em>here</em>
he stands, as one among the great ones of the <em>show</em>! The
amiability of Albert, that &ldquo;excellent Prince,&rdquo; and
therefore &ldquo;<em>most</em> excellent young man,&rdquo; is
ingeniously contrasted with the vices of a Greenacre, and the
villany of a <em>Hare</em>. The stern endurance and unflinching
perseverance of the zealous and single-hearted Calvin is deprived
of its exclusiveness by the more exciting and equally famous Sir
William Courtenay (<em>alias</em> Thom).</p>
<p>The thrilling recollection of the &ldquo;poet peer,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;peerless poet,&rdquo; the highly-imaginative and unrivalled
Byron, whose flood of song, poured out in one continuous stream of
varied passion-breathing fancy, is calmed by gazing on &ldquo;dull
life&rsquo;s antipodes,&rdquo; the bandaged remnant of a dried-up
mummy!</p>
<p>Poor Mary Stuart! the beautiful, the murdered Queen of Scots, is
only parted from the &ldquo;Maiden Queen,&rdquo; who sealed her
doom, by the interposition of the blood-stained ruthless wretch
(England&rsquo;s Eighth Harry), to whom &ldquo;Bess&rdquo; owed her
birth!</p>
<p>Pitt, Fox, and Canning are matched with Courvoisier, Gould, and
Collins.</p>
<p>Liston is <em>vis &agrave; vis</em> to Joe Hume, while Louis
Philippe but shares attention with the rivalling models of the
Bastille and Guillotine!</p>
<p>Verily, there is a moral in all this, &ldquo;an we could but
find it out.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
